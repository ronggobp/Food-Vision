Use the same evaluation techniques on the large-scale Food Vision model as you did in the previous notebook ([Transfer Learning Part 3: Scaling up](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/06_transfer_learning_in_tensorflow_part_3_scaling_up.ipynb)). More specifically, it would be good to see:\n","  * A confusion matrix between all of the model's predictions and true labels.\n","  * A graph showing the f1-scores of each class.\n","  * A visualization of the model making predictions on various images and comparing the predictions to the ground truth.\n","    * For example, plot a sample image from the test dataset and have the title of the plot show the prediction, the prediction probability and the ground truth label.\n","2. Take 3 of your own photos of food and use the Food Vision model to make predictions on them. How does it go? Share your images/predictions with the other students.\n","3. Retrain the model (feature extraction and fine-tuning) we trained in this notebook, except this time use [`EfficientNetB4`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/EfficientNetB4) as the base model instead of `EfficientNetB0`. Do you notice an improvement in performance? Does it take longer to train? Are there any tradeoffs to consider?\n","4.
